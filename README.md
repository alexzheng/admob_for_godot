# admob_for_godot
This is the AdMob module for Godot Engine (https://github.com/okamstudio/godot)
for both iOS and Android.


Android module is from https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob.git 
and I made some API modification.


Supported Ads:
Banner
intersitial
Rewarded video

Both modules have exactly the same APIs and call back method.
You can write the same scripts for both platforms.
