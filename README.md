# admob_for_godot
This is the AdMob module for Godot Engine (https://github.com/okamstudio/godot)

For both iOS and Android.


Android module is from https://github.com/kloder-games/godot-admob.git 

And I made some API modification.


Supported Ads:

Banner

intersitial

Rewarded video

Both modules have exactly the same APIs and call back method.

You can write the same scripts for both platforms.
